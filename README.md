Add new words to a student's vocabulary and make the words stick (grab them).

This will include tools to measure current vocabulary size by testing sample words in an exponential distribution from a word list sorted by usage frequency. For more accurate measurement, the testing can zoom in on the estimated upper limit of the student's vocabulary. 
Once approximate vocabulary size is known, it can be expanded by drilling new words with spaced-repetition flashcards. 
In order to exercise the new vocabulary, there will be several word challenges. A student can use their new vocabulary to make anagrams, find rhyming pairs, and match other word patterns. 
Students can complete these challenges alone or with a timer, against other students, or against an artificial intelligence. 
Vograbulary will include definitions for the words, brief readings from public domain works, plus links to the complete works for further reading.
